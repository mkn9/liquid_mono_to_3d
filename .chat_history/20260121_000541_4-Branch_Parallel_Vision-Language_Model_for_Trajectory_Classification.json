If we take a shortcut, we don't truly have a vision language model. let's include at least one test in our TDD testing process that ensures that. What parallel approaches might be applicable for this? I think three or four get tree branches might be appropriate."

I agree with the week one foundation part of the plan, although I'm not sure 600 samples is going to be enough. make sure the branches run in parallel, that they periodically update the status and that they periodically write results in a place it's visible on the MacBook. Unless they are stock, there is no reason to stop before completing all four branches. Of course use our TDD testing procedures correctly."
