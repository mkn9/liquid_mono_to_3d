We have successfully trained and demonstrated magnet. Please find the complete history of what we've done with magnet and recommend what we can leverage there to train it and integrate it thoroughly with our project now."

      "content": "Conducted complete audit of all MAGVIT work across the entire project, chat histories, and git commits. CRITICAL FINDING: MAGVIT was never actually integrated into mono_to_3d despite folder/branch names claiming otherwise. All 'MAGVIT' training used simple 3D CNNs or fallback features.\n\nKEY DISCOVERIES:\n1. Four 'MAGVIT' branches (Jan 21): Actually used simple 3D CNNs, NO MAGVIT components (84.6% best accuracy)\n2. MAGVIT integration attempts (Dec 2025): All fell back to kinematic features, NOT MAGVIT (93.5% best with statistical features)\n3. MAGVIT visualization work: Just trajectory generators/camera projection, misleadingly named\n4. ONLY REAL MAGVIT USE: Pretrained comparison (Jan 12) achieved 16% accuracy, concluded unsuitable for synthetic trajectories\n\nWHAT WE HAVE:\n- Separate working MAGVIT repo on MacBook (/Users/mike/Dropbox/Code/repos/MAGVIT/)\n- Google JAX MAGVIT code on EC2 (experiments/magvit-3d-trajectories/magvit/)\n- magvit2-pytorch library installed but never used\n- Excellent infrastructure: trajectory generation, camera system, baseline 92.5% accuracy\n\nWHAT WE DON'T HAVE:\n- MAGVIT VQ-VAE trained on trajectory videos\n- Video tokenization pipeline integrated\n- Any working MAGVIT integration in mono_to_3d\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED (4 options):\n1. Honest Baseline (1-2 days): Continue with improved 3D CNN, achieve 95%+ without MAGVIT\n2. Integrate Separate MAGVIT Repo (2-3 days): Use working PyTorch MAGVIT, get real tokenization\n3. Train MAGVIT from Scratch (2-4 weeks): Full research project using magvit2-pytorch\n4. Use Google JAX MAGVIT (2-4 weeks): Original implementation, paper replication\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n- Created comprehensive documentation: docs/MAGVIT_COMPREHENSIVE_HISTORY_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (500+ lines)\n- Created non-interactive chat history script: scripts/save_chat_auto.py\n- Updated chat history for session\n\nNext step: User to specify goal (accuracy, quick MAGVIT, or research) to proceed with appropriate option."
