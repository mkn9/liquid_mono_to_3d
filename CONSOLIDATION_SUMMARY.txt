================================================================================
BENEFITS
================================================================================

✅ Single Source of Truth
   - requirements.md is now comprehensive
   - No confusion about which document is authoritative
   - All procedures in one place

✅ Reduced Maintenance
   - Update one file instead of three
   - No risk of procedures getting out of sync
   - Easier to keep documentation current

✅ Better Organization
   - Clear section hierarchy
   - All chat history in Section 3.4
   - All EC2 operations in Section 4
   - Logical flow and grouping

✅ Easier Discovery
   - Developers know where to look
   - Table of contents shows all topics
   - No scattered documentation

================================================================================
WHAT REMAINS SEPARATE (AND WHY)
================================================================================

These files are intentionally kept separate:

1. ✅ Experiment-Specific Documentation
   - experiments/magvit-3d-trajectories/*.md
   - neural_video_experiments/README.md
   Reason: Specific to individual experiments

2. ✅ Third-Party Documentation
   - D-NeRF/README.md
   Reason: External framework documentation

3. ✅ Analysis Results
   - SENSOR_IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md
   Reason: Research results, not procedures

4. ✅ Historical Context
   - EVIDENCE_BASED_TDD_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   Reason: Implementation history and rationale

5. ✅ Implementation Summaries
   - docs/CHAT_HISTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt
   Reason: Summary documents, not core requirements

6. ✅ Helper Tool Documentation
   - scripts/README.md
   Reason: Script-specific usage (still referenced in requirements.md)

7. ✅ Coordinate System Documentation
   - COORDINATE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
   Reason: Could be integrated, but detailed enough to stand alone

================================================================================
VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Confirmed changes:

✅ requirements.md Section 3.4 expanded (now comprehensive)
✅ requirements.md Section 4.9 added (EC2 operations)
✅ CHAT_HISTORY_PROCEDURES.md deleted
✅ CHAT_HISTORY_QUICKSTART.md deleted
✅ EC2_SHUTDOWN_PREPARATION.md deleted
✅ README.md updated (references removed)
✅ docs/chat_history/README.md updated
✅ docs/CHAT_HISTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md updated

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR USERS
================================================================================

1. Review the updated requirements.md
   - Section 3.4 for all chat history procedures
   - Section 4.9 for EC2 shutdown/restart procedures

2. Update any personal notes or bookmarks
   - Point to requirements.md instead of deleted files

3. When looking for procedures:
   - First check: requirements.md
   - Table of contents shows all sections
   - Use Cmd+F / Ctrl+F to search within file

4. Commit the changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: consolidate procedures into requirements.md"
   git push

================================================================================
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH ACHIEVED ✅
================================================================================

requirements.md is now the comprehensive, authoritative source for:
- All governance standards
- All development procedures
- All workflow instructions
- All environment setup
- All testing standards

**Status: Documentation consolidation complete**
