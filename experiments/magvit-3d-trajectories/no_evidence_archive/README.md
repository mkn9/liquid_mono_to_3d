# Archive of work without evidence capture

This directory contains MAGVIT 3D work from Jan 18, 2026 that lacked evidence files.

**Issue:** Documentation claimed TDD was followed but no captured evidence existed.

**Resolution:** Recreating with proper evidence capture (Jan 19, 2026).

**Files archived:**
- magvit_3d_generator.py (implementation)
- generate_dataset.py (generation script)
- TDD_VERIFIED_RESULTS.md (documentation without evidence)
- results/ (generated outputs)

**Reason for archive:** Integrity protocol requires verifiable evidence for TDD claims.
