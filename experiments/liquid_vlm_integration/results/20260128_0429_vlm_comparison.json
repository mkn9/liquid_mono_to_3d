    "\n\nIn this case, the trajectory is a straight line with a slope of -1. The initial point (0, 1) is the origin, and the endpoint (1, 0) is the maximum value. The point (0.5, 0.5) is halfway between the origin and the endpoint, and the point (1.5, 1.5) is halfway between the origin and the endpoint. The slope is always -1, so the trajectory is a straight line with a slope of -1.\n\nExample 4: Determine the slope of a line passing through the points (0, 1) and (2, 3).\n\nThe line passing",

How long will it take for the object to reach the opposite side of the line?\n\nThis is determined by the distance between the object and the line, which is given by the length of the line segment.
