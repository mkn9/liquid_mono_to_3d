ABLATION STUDY: Measuring True Visual Understanding
======================================================================

Purpose: Determine if visual embeddings actually contribute to accuracy
Method: Compare 3 conditions with same LLM (GPT-4)

Device: cpu

📦 Creating sample data...
✅ 10 samples created

======================================================================
CONDITION 1: Cheating Baseline (Ground Truth → LLM)
======================================================================
Task: Text-to-text conversion of numbers to sentences
Expected accuracy: ~75% (from previous evaluation)

======================================================================
CONDITION 2: Random Embeddings (Control)
======================================================================
Task: LLM tries to understand random noise
Expected accuracy: ~25% (random chance)
  Sample 0: 50.0%
  Sample 1: 50.0%
  Sample 2: 75.0%
  Sample 3: 50.0%
  Sample 4: 50.0%
  Sample 5: 50.0%
  Sample 6: 50.0%
  Sample 7: 50.0%
  Sample 8: 50.0%
  Sample 9: 50.0%

======================================================================
CONDITION 3: Real Embeddings (True Visual)
======================================================================
Task: LLM understands visual-spatial embeddings
Expected accuracy: 40-60% (challenging)
  Sample 0: 50.0%
  Sample 1: 50.0%
  Sample 2: 50.0%
  Sample 3: 75.0%
  Sample 4: 50.0%
  Sample 5: 50.0%
  Sample 6: 50.0%
  Sample 7: 50.0%
  Sample 8: 50.0%
  Sample 9: 50.0%

======================================================================
RESULTS SUMMARY
======================================================================
Cheating Baseline (Ground Truth → LLM):  75.0%
Random Embeddings (Control):             52.5%
Real Embeddings (Visual):                52.5%

Improvement over random:  +0.0%
Gap vs cheating baseline: -22.5%

INTERPRETATION:
❌ Visual embeddings NOT helping
   Pipeline may have issues - investigate Liquid fusion
