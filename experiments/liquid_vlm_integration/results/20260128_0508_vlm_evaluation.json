As the cube rotates, the 3D model follows the cube's trajectory through space, resulting in a smooth and continuous motion.\n\nThe 3D model is created using the Unity game engine and is built using a rigged model with joints. The rigging process creates a hierarchy of joints that allow the animation to be controlled in a 3D space.\n\nThe video demonstrates how the Unity game engine allows for the creation of 3D models with complex shapes",
